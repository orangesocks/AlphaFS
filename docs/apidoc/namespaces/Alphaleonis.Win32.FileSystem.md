The `Filesystem` namespace contains classes to access and work with the local filesystem. Many of the classes in this namespace are replicas of the ones available in the System.IO namespace, but with added functionality. All methods in this namespace accept long windows unicode paths (i.e. paths starting with `\\?\`). 

Additional classes and methods are provided to provide more advanced functionality than that of `System.IO`.
